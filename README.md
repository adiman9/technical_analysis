# Technical Analysis

This project aims to provide robust and extensible tools for better understanding market behavior and gaining insights on future trends. It has three pillars of focus:

1. Fetching historic and live data relevant to market behavior (e.g. GDAX candles, tweets, etc.)
2. Training plugins using historic data
3. Inferring future market behavior using live data and knowledge gained through training


## Installing Dependencies

First, ensure that [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) are installed. Then, run the following from the project's root:

```shell
yarn install
```


## Configuring the Environment

This repository's scripts use [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to manage environment variables. All variables documented in [`.env.template`](./.env.template) must be defined either in a `.env` file (located at the project root) or configured on the system.

__Note: Currently there are no required environment variables, but if future plugins require API keys, this is where they should live.__

In addition to any environment variables, there are a handful of required shared settings defined in [`./settings.js`](./settings.js), notably `mongoUri`, `mongoDatabaseName`, and `priceHistoryDir`. The default values are sensible, but should be reviewed.


## Fetching Historic Data

Most/all plugins will require historic data for training. Listed below are the strategies currently available for collecting data:

### Historic GDAX Candles

To fetch GDAX's historic candle data for the product, timeframe, and candle size indicated in [`./settings.js`](./settings.js), run the following from the project root:

```shell
yarn run fetch-price-history
```

### Historic Tweets

_Coming Soon..._


## Training With Historic Data

Once the necessary data has been fetched, configure the desired training plugins (described below) in [`./settings.js`](./settings.js), then run the `train` script from the project root:

```shell
yarn run train
```

### Available Training Plugins

#### Bullish Engulfing Trainer

The Bullish Engulfing Trainer identifies historic instances of bullish engulfing candles and calculates the probability of various percent-price increases in the near-term future. For this exercise, a bullish engulfing candle is defined as having:

1. a higher closing price than opening price
2. a taller candle body than all recent candles
3. a closing price that is at or near its highest price
4. larger volume than all recent candles

The plugin requires the following to be configured:

- __product__: The trading pair to be analyzed, e.g. `BTC-USD`
- __priceHistoryFile__: The absolute path to a historic GDAX candle file generated by the script mentioned in the "Historic GDAX Candles" section
- __dbCollection__: The mongo collection into which the results will be inserted
- __lookbackCandles__: The number of previous candles that the current candle needs to be larger than in order to be considered "engulfing"
- __lookaheadCandles__: The maximum number of candles to look ahead when determining the highs following a bullish engulfing candle
- __allowedWickToBodyRatio__: The maximum body-to-upper-wick ratio that is allowed for a candle to be considered engulfing
- __groupSizeForPctPriceIncreaseProbability__: The grouping size applied when calculating the probability of the price increasing by a particular percentage


#### Twitter Sentiment Trainer

## Inferring Based On Live Data

Once the necessary training has been completed (see "Training With Historic Data" section), configure the desired training plugins (described below) in [`./settings.js`](./settings.js), then run the `infer` script from the project root:

```shell
yarn run infer
```

### Available Inferring Plugins

#### Bulllish Engulfing Inferrer

When the most current candle meets the criteria defined in the "Bullish Engulfing Trainer" section, the Bullish Engulfing Inferrer emits a `BullishEngulfingInferrer.CURRENT_CANDLE_IS_BULLISH_ENGULFING` event, which contains data about the most recent candle, along with probabilities of various percentage-price increases over the next `lookaheadCandles` candles. The plugin requires the following to be configured:

- __product__: The trading pair to be analyzed, e.g. `BTC-USD`
- __dbCollection__: The mongo collection where Bullish Engulfing Training data is stored
- __lookbackCandles__: The number of previous candles that the current candle needs to be larger than in order to be considered "engulfing"
- __lookaheadCandles__: The maximum number of candles to look ahead when determining the highs following a bullish engulfing candle (used to identify the appropriate training data)
- __allowedWickToBodyRatio__: The maximum body-to-upper-wick ratio that is allowed for a candle to be considered engulfing

##### Example Usage (see [./bin/infer.js](./bin/infer.js))

```javascript
const inferrer = new QuantInferrer(mongoUri, mongoDatabaseName, fetcherConfigs, pluginConfigs);

inferrer.on(BullishEngulfingInferrer.events.CURRENT_CANDLE_IS_BULLISH_ENGULFING, (pluginConfig, candle, probabilities) => {
  console.log(`CURRENT_CANDLE_IS_BULLISH_ENGULFING at ${ formatTime() }`);
  console.log(`...${ pluginConfig.product }: ${ formatUSD(candle.close) }`);
  probabilities.forEach(({ probability, pctPriceChange }) => {
    if (probability >= 0.8 && pctPriceChange > 0) {
      console.log(`......${ formatPercent(probability) } likelihood of increasing by ${ formatPercent(pctPriceChange) } over the next ${ pluginConfig.lookaheadCandles } candles`);
    }
  });
});

inferrer.run();
```
